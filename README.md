### Hello, My name is Onur ðŸ‘‹

I work on web design and programming. I am trying to improve myself in this field. I really love coding. I usually like to write interesting projects.I graduated from BartÄ±n University Management Information Systems department. I am currently interested in PHP Laravel, Ruby on Rails and React Js. Previously, I was interested in languages such as C#, Asp.Net Mvc, Python. I usually worked on school projects. Some of my repositories are currently private and I can open them upon request. Some of these repos are Asp.Net Mvc Admin Panel and Corporate Website and Android On-Duty Pharmacy system.

My hobbies are playing guitar and reading books.
